read_library [-ainr] filename
.PP
Read a \fBSIS\fR-format library for future technology mapping.
The \fB-a\fP option appends the library to the current library;
otherwise, any previous library is discarded.
The \fB-i\fP flag suppresses adding extra inverters to all of the
primitives.  This is intended for debugging only.
The \fB-n\fP flag requests that a library, if it is generated, be
made using NAND gates rather than NOR gates.
The \fB-r\fP flag reads a raw library format (given in BLIF)
rather than the normal genlib format.
