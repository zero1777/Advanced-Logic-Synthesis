print_state 
.PP
Prints out the current state of the machine for both the STG
and the logic implementation.
For the logic implementation, the current state is printed as
a string of integers representing the values on the latches:
0, 1, 2 (don't care), and 3 (undefined).
For the STG, the current state is printed with its symbolic
and encoded names.
