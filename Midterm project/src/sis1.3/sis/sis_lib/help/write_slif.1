write_slif [-s] [-n] [-d] [filename]
.PP
Write the current network to the file \fBfilename\fP in the Stanford Logic
Interchange Format (\fISLIF\fP).
.PP
The \fB-s\fP option uses the network short names rather than the network
long names for the \fISLIF\fP file.  This can be used to encrypt the names of a
net-list.
.PP
The \fB-n\fP option uses the net-list format of \fISLIF\fP when a node has a
gate implementation in the library.
.PP
The \fB-d\fP option makes the \fISLIF\fR writer print out any delay information
known about the current network.  This is not the default because a standard
for printing delay information has not been established for the
\fISLIF\fP format.
