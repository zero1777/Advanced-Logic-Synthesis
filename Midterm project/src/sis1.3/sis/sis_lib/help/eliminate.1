eliminate [-l limit] thresh
.PP
Eliminate all the nodes in the network whose 
value is less than or equal to \fBthresh\fR.
The value of a node represents the number of literals saved
in the literal count for the network by leaving the
node in the network.
If the value is less than (or equal to) the threshold, the node
will be eliminated by collapsing the node into each of its fanouts.
A primary input or a primary output will not be eliminated.
.PP
The value of the node is approximated based on
the number of times the node is used
in the factored form for each of its fanouts.
Note that if a node is used only once, its value is always -1.
.PP
\fBlimit\fR is used to control the maximum number of cubes
in any node.  The default is 1000.  Using a very large \fBlimit\fR
may result in collapsing the network to two levels.  In general,
if the circuit is collapsible, the command \fBcollapse\fR is
more efficient.
