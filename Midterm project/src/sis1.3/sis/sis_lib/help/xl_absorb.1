xl_absorb [-n support] [-f MAX_FANINS] [-v]
.PP
Given a possibly infeasible network, moves fanins of the nodes so as
to decrease their number of fanins. Some infeasible
nodes may become feasible and decomposition may not be applied on
them. 
.PP
\fB-n\fP: support is the size of the TLU block (default = 5)
.br
.PP
\fB-f\fP: Does not move fanins of a node if it has more than MAX_FANINS
(default 15). 
.br
.PP
\fB-v\fP: turns on the verbosity flag.  When used, information about the
   algorithm is printed as it executes.
