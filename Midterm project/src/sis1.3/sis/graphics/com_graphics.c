/* com_graphics.c -- sis general graphics commands.

   Currently there are no general purpose graphics commands.  File graphics.doc
   describes how sis interacts with a graphical front end.  The interface is
   based on the existing tty command-line interface so that either interface
   can be used without recompiling sis.
